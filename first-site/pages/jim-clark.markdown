Following multiple further podiums in 1961, Lotus fielded the highly-successful 25 chassis from 1962 onwards. Clark took his maiden win at the 1962 Belgian Grand Prix, achieving further wins at his home Grand Prix in Great Britain and in the United States, as he finished runner-up to career rival Graham Hill. After winning a then-record seven Grands Prix during his 1963 campaign, Clark won his maiden title, earning widespread acclaim for his dominant performances. Despite winning the most races the following season, reliability issues with the Lotus 33 saw him fall to third in the standings. However, the chassis would excel in the hands of Clark in 1965, as he took six victories in another record-breaking season. Lotus then struggled to adapt to the 3-litre engine era, with Clark only able to win the United States Grand Prix during his second title defence. 1967 was far more successful for Lotus under Cosworth power, with Clark taking four wins throughout the season but again let down by poor reliability.
